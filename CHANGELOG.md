# Changelog

All notable changes to PilotProxy are recorded here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Per-pilot product schema v3 --- retain the per-frame PSD

`chime-scan` now records `psd_frame_db_i16`, the per-frame power spectrum with
feeds summed, as int16 in dB about a per-product reference.

The analyzer already computed this array every frame and threw it away, so the
change costs no compute. It closes the limitation `archive_health` documents:
the v1 gate cannot apply a new frame mask, window, or threshold to the two
archived accumulators, because the per-frame spectra were gone.

Measured on real CHIME data: 0.005 dB maximum round-trip error, and summing the
retained frames reproduces the integrated spectrum to 7.7e-4. About 18 kB per
frame after deflate.


## Per-pilot product schema v2 --- retain the exact fine terms

`chime-scan` now records `fine_power_u64` (`[N, 3, 256]` `uint64`, the frozen
`fxfft256` terms) plus the unsummed `p_ref_lower_u64` / `p_ref_upper_u64`.

v1 retained only the float32 `fine_power_ratio`, which is neither the deployed
statistic nor invertible to it, so no exact Q16 fine decision could be replayed
from an archived product. v1 products are rejected rather than migrated: the
missing integers cannot be reconstructed without reprocessing raw baseband.

Adds about 4.4 kB/frame compressed.


## Unreleased

This is the development line for PilotProxy 2.0. It deliberately removes
pre-2.0 Python aliases, duplicated command entry points, and receiver-specific
names from receiver-neutral contracts. Existing products must be regenerated;
the stricter validators do not reinterpret incomplete legacy products.

### Added

- `pilot-proxy-control`, a datatrawl analyzer for non-pilot control freq_ids
  (`pilotproxy_control_product_v1`): per-frame `baseband_power_linear` in the
  detector's native units, a per-frame K=128 rectangular coarse power marginal
  (the unit-modulus analogue of the deployed statistic, so
  `F(b) = 2*S[b] / (S[b-2] + S[b+2])` is recoverable offline at any bin,
  including a virtual-pilot bin on channels with no transmitter), one
  full-resolution integrated spectrum, and the same freq_id-stripped
  `source_event_keys` the combine step joins on. CPU-only by default
  (`--set gpu=1` optional and excluded from the resume fingerprint); the
  deployed detector remains the only mask authority.

### Changed

- Reference-placement diagnostics now say what the `edge_wrapped` bookkeeping
  flag means physically (`frame_origin_description`: under a center-at-DC
  profile the wrap crosses the coarse-channel center/DC, not the channel edge)
  and report references requested beyond +-fs/2 of the channel center
  (`*_crosses_channel_edge`, `channel_edge_notes`); `list-channels` prints the
  corresponding `NOTE`s, including for manifests written before these fields
  existed. Weight values and placements are unchanged; regenerating a manifest
  changes its hash only.
- Tightened receiver, stream-map, detector-core, runtime-bundle, and product
  compatibility validation.
- Replaced the receiver-specific CHIME detector-contract identity with the
  receiver-neutral `pilotproxy_detector_contract_v1` contract.
- Centralized duplicated detector preprocessing and schema identities.
- Updated generated specifications and operational documentation to describe
  the current product contract.
- Separated historical provenance from supported runtime behavior.

### Removed

- The receiver-specific CHIME detector-contract token and its public builder
  aliases. Use `pilotproxy_detector_contract_v1`, `build_detector_contract`,
  and `validate_detector_contract`.
- Result-summary helpers from the `pilot_proxy.testbench` package root. Import
  them from `pilot_proxy.testbench.summarize_results`.
- The duplicate `scripts/fulldepth_and_subsets.py` analysis entry point. The
  historical paper provenance remains archived, but it is not a supported
  runtime command.
- Ambiguous SNR-summary aliases `num_positive_excess_frames` and
  `positive_excess_fraction`. The replacement columns state that they count
  finite data-shelf SNR estimates among detector-valid frames.

### Fixed

- `chime-baseband-packed` now classifies open/schema failures as an
  unreadable unit via datatrawl's `unreadable_file()` (quarantine + continue),
  matching the built-in `chime-baseband` reader, instead of crashing an entire
  archive scan on one corrupt file.
- `tests/datatrawl` inventory fixtures write full current-schema rows
  (`scope`, `name`) required by datatrawl's fail-closed inventory validation,
  and the event-keyed combine test expects the source's logical unit key
  (scope/event/name triple) rather than the legacy URI form.

- Propagated CUDA API failures to Python callers.
- Prevented debug CUDA builds from being reused as release artifacts.
- Preserved receiver-specific sample rates throughout combined products.

## 1.0.0

- Initial public release.
