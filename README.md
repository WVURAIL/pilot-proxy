`pilot-proxy` evaluates an F-statistic detector for Advanced Television Systems
Committee (ATSC) 1.0 digital television (DTV) signals. We use the narrow ATSC
pilot tone as a measurable proxy for the broadband data shelf. This provides a
narrow-band observable when the shelf is below the instantaneous noise level.
The repository includes a standalone CUDA detector and a GNU Radio validation
testbench.

The package has two main workflows:

1. **Standalone synthetic/testbench mode** for ATSC generation without injected
   noise, quantization, CUDA-kernel evaluation, and controlled SNR sweeps.
2. **CHIME real-data mode** for baseband HDF5 data. The recommended archive-scale
   entry point is `pilot-proxy chime-scan`. This command runs the PilotProxy
   analyzer through the `datatrawl` streaming engine, then attempts to combine
   the per-pilot products into the canonical CHIME outputs.

The detector core is telescope-independent. A receiver integration supplies the
metadata and arrays needed to satisfy the CUDA kernel contract; it does not
change that contract.

## Choose your workflow

The repository supports several workflows with different dependencies. Choose
the row that matches the result you need:

| Goal | Guide to follow | Needs GPU? | Needs datatrawl? |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| Run the CHIME detector on the CADC archive (`chime-scan`) | [docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md](docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md) | Yes | Yes |
| Check the package installs and the CLI loads | This README: minimal CPU-only smoke test (below) | No | No |
| Generate / audit synthetic ATSC | This README: standalone testbench | Partly | No |
| Run the CUDA detector / SNR evaluation | This README: standalone CUDA path | Yes | No |
| Publication SNR sweeps without a GPU | This README: `pilot-proxy evaluate-snr --detector-backend cpu-reference --noise-source python` | No | No |

For a CANFAR run, begin with the
[runbook](docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md). It gives the required order: launch the
session, clone both repositories, run `setup_env.sh` to build the environment
and CUDA kernel, survey the archive, and run the scan. The standalone sections
below are not prerequisites. `setup_env.sh` performs its own sanity checks, so
the README smoke test is also optional on that path.

---

## Environment

We run the standalone workflows in one Python virtual environment. The virtual
environment can be in any writable, persistent directory; it does **not** need
to be inside the source checkout. The selected Python must include `venv` and
`ensurepip`. On a minimal Debian or Ubuntu installation, install
`python3-venv`, or set `PYTHON_BIN` to a Miniconda or session Python that already
provides them.

```bash
export VENV_DIR="${VENV_DIR:-$HOME/.venvs/pilot-proxy-datatrawl}"
export PYTHON_BIN="${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$VENV_DIR")"
"$PYTHON_BIN" -m venv --system-site-packages "$VENV_DIR"
source "$VENV_DIR/bin/activate"
```

Shared and image-managed Python installations may be read-only or marked as
PEP 668 externally managed. In those environments, install into the virtual
environment rather than using bare `pip`. The `--system-site-packages` option
keeps a session image's CuPy and CUDA packages visible to the GPU workflows.
Activate the environment in every **new** session. It persists only when
`VENV_DIR` is on persistent storage, such as `/arc` on CANFAR. The CANFAR
runbook uses `setup_env.sh`, which creates and recreates its own configured
environment; do not create that environment by hand.

---

## Fresh clone and minimal CPU-only smoke test

This smoke test checks the Python package, CLI entry point, and reference
detector metadata. It does **not** require GNU Radio, datatrawl, CADC
credentials, CUDA, or CHIME HDF5 data. Run it inside the
[environment](#environment) above before using a standalone workflow.

```bash
export REPO_DIR="${REPO_DIR:-$PWD/pilot-proxy}"
git clone https://github.com/WVURAIL/pilot-proxy.git "$REPO_DIR"
cd "$REPO_DIR"
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"

pilot-proxy --help
python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py -q
pilot-proxy check-profile \
    --receiver-profile configs/receiver_profiles/reference_800mhz_pfb.json
pilot-proxy check-layout \
    --receiver-profile configs/receiver_profiles/reference_800mhz_pfb.json
```

### Repository test targets

The smoke test runs only `tests/test_cli.py`. To run the repository's Python
test target, install the test extra and use:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
make test-python
```

The `test` extra includes `h5py` because the checked-in tests exercise the CHIME
HDF5 adapters. These tests generate or mock their inputs, so they do not require
CHIME data files. Tests that import optional packages, including the datatrawl
integration suite, are skipped when those packages are not installed.

`make test` runs `test-kernel` before `test-python`; therefore, it is **not** a
CPU-only target. Use it on a CUDA build host after checking both the driver and
compiler:

```bash
command -v nvidia-smi && nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,compute_cap --format=csv
command -v nvcc && nvcc --version
```

`nvidia-smi` is part of the NVIDIA driver tooling, not Python. On WSL, it is
provided through a Windows NVIDIA driver with WSL CUDA support. On Linux, it is
provided by the NVIDIA driver packages. If `nvidia-smi` is unavailable, use
`make test-python` instead of `make test` or `make test-kernel`. The
`make release-check` target adds CPU C/C++ reference checks, profile and layout
checks, and runtime-bundle validation. It requires a C++ compiler but not a GPU.

We commit the documentation sources. Generated PDFs, figures, products, and
CUDA shared libraries are build artifacts and should not be committed.

Built wheels include the shipped receiver profiles, stream map, weight bank, and
weight manifest. The CUDA shared library is architecture-specific and is not
included. Before running the GPU detector, build the library from a source
checkout and stage it under ``~/.cache/pilot_proxy/libfstatistic.so``.

---

## Setup for the CHIME / CANFAR workflow

The integrated workflow uses checkouts of both `pilot-proxy` and `datatrawl`.
The `scripts/setup_env.sh` script recreates a virtual environment, installs both
repositories in editable mode with the CADC, survey, CHIME, and test extras,
resolves CuPy through datatrawl's `accel` module, and checks plugin discovery.
On a GPU node, it also requires `nvcc`, builds the CUDA kernel, and checks that
the kernel loads. Because the script **removes and recreates** the target
environment, do not set `VENV_DIR` to an environment you need to preserve.

The full procedure is in
[docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md](docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md#environment-setup).
It gives the exact `setup_env.sh` invocation, a manual setup that does not
recreate an environment, GPU-session launch, Harbor registry credentials,
required inputs, and bounded run sequences. Integration-specific details are in
[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md#setup).

---

## Receiver integration contract

A receiver integration translates telescope data into the detector's fixed
input contract. It provides:

- `receiver_profile.json` describing RF band, channelizer geometry, spectral
  sense, frame size, input streams, quantization policy, bin ENBW, and pilot
  capture efficiency;
- optional `stream_map.json` describing the input-stream ordering;
- channelized complex input arrays or packed detector matrices;
- a generated weight bank built from the receiver profile.

After this translation, the CUDA kernel sees only:

- packed int4 detector rows;
- packed int4 weights;
- uint64 target/reference powers.

CHIME run products record the detector contract in
`run_config.json` and `stats.json` with:

- `schema_version = pilotproxy_chime_detector_contract_v1`;
- K, weight-term, skipped-guard, and reference-offset geometry;
- packed input and uint64 accumulator metadata;
- the all-row summation rule;
- the positive-excess mask policy;
- reference-placement summary metadata.

Validate integration metadata with:

```bash
pilot-proxy check-profile   --receiver-profile configs/receiver_profiles/chime_dtv_fengine.json

pilot-proxy check-layout   --receiver-profile configs/receiver_profiles/chime_dtv_fengine.json   --stream-map configs/stream_maps/chime_feed_pol_example.json
```

The shipped receiver profiles have different roles and evidential status:

- `reference_800mhz_pfb.json` is the single-stream detector-coordinate reference
  profile used for shipped reference weights and tests.
- `chime_dtv_fengine.json` is the target CHIME DTV adapter profile used by the
  current integration: 2048 feed-polarization streams, inverted spectral sense,
  descending RF channel order, and `frame_size_samples=16384`. The 16384-sample
  frame is the target for the CHIME Engine upgrade, not a claim about the
  currently deployed frame. The file is explicitly marked
  `example_requires_data_product_verification`; therefore, verify these values
  against the data product used for an operational run.

---

## Weight bank

We generate the default CHIME DTV weight bank from the receiver and detector
profiles:

```bash
pilot-proxy make-weights   --receiver-profile configs/receiver_profiles/chime_dtv_fengine.json   --detector-core-profile configs/detector_core/pilotproxy_cuda_fstat_v1.json   --physical-channel-range 14:36   --weight-coordinate-system post_spectral_sense_normalization   --output weights/chime_dtv_weights_k128.bin
```

By default, the detector looks for:

```text
weights/chime_dtv_weights_k128.bin
```

The `.bin` file contains detector weights; it is not an executable. Leave it at
the default path, or pass the path explicitly to a command that consumes the
weights:

```bash
pilot-proxy list-channels --weights-path weights/chime_dtv_weights_k128.bin
pilot-proxy chime-run --weights-path weights/chime_dtv_weights_k128.bin --help
```

`list-channels` reports the reference placement for each physical channel.
Adaptive cases also print an explanatory `NOTE` without changing the CSV
output. The shipped K=128 bank uses `reference_offset_bins=2` and
`skipped_guard_bins=1`. We skip one fine bin on each side of the target and use
the next fine bin as the lower or upper reference. A reference that crosses a
coarse-channel edge wraps around the circular coarse-channel FFT. A reference
that collides with the forbidden coarse-channel DC tone moves one bin farther
from the target, and the manifest records a placement warning. A target-DC
collision stops weight generation because the target cannot be moved.

For the shipped ATSC 14-36 CHIME bank, physical channel 21 is the only adaptive
case: its lower reference wraps across the coarse-channel edge. Physical channel
14 places DC inside the skipped guard region, but neither the target nor a
reference collides with DC. It is therefore not marked adaptive.

For deployment, export the profiles and weights as a compact runtime bundle,
then validate that bundle:

```bash
pilot-proxy export-runtime-weight-bundle   --receiver-profile configs/receiver_profiles/chime_dtv_fengine.json   --detector-core-profile configs/detector_core/pilotproxy_cuda_fstat_v1.json   --weight-coordinate-system post_spectral_sense_normalization   --physical-channel-range 14:36   --output-dir generated/deploy/chime_dtv_k128

pilot-proxy validate-runtime-weight-bundle   --bundle-dir generated/deploy/chime_dtv_k128
```

---

## CUDA kernel

On a GPU host:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,compute_cap --format=csv
```

The build uses the integer `SM` form of the compute capability. Remove the
decimal point to obtain it:

| Compute capability | `SM` |
|---:|---:|
| 8.0 | 80 |
| 8.6 | 86 |
| 8.9 | 89 |
| 9.0 | 90 |

The Python GPU path uses CuPy. In the integrated CHIME/CANFAR workflow,
`setup_env.sh` resolves CuPy through datatrawl's `accel` API. For a standalone
CUDA 12.x workflow, use `python -m pip install -e ".[cuda]"`. The `cuda` extra
installs `cupy-cuda12x`; use the corresponding `cupy-cudaXXx` package when the
runtime is not CUDA 12.x.

Both `setup_env.sh` and the `make` targets detect `SM` from the first GPU visible
to `nvidia-smi`. Pass `SM=<arch>` only when detection fails or when
cross-compiling for another architecture. The build records the architecture
and kernel configuration in its build stamp. If either value changes, the next
build recompiles the kernel.

### CUDA toolchain (`nvcc`)

The kernel build requires the CUDA compiler, `nvcc`. Check that it is on
`PATH`:

```bash
command -v nvcc && nvcc --version
```

On some CANFAR CUDA images, `nvcc` is installed under `/usr/local/cuda/bin` but
that directory is not on `PATH`. If `command -v nvcc` returns a path such as
`/usr/bin/nvcc`, use `make build-kernel` without setting `NVCC`. Otherwise,
locate the compiler:

```bash
find /usr/local -maxdepth 4 -path '*/bin/nvcc' -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Then add its directory to `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/cuda/bin:$PATH
```

Alternatively, pass the compiler path directly. `cuda/Makefile` honors
`NVCC=`:

```bash
make build-kernel NVCC=/path/to/cuda/bin/nvcc
```

If `nvcc` is absent, use a CANFAR image that includes the CUDA *toolkit*, such as
`skaha/astroml-cuda`, or install a toolkit that matches the runtime. A
runtime-only image may run CuPy while still lacking the compiler needed for this
kernel. In that case, `make test` and `make test-kernel` stop at the `nvcc`
step. On a CPU-only host, use `make test-python` or `make release-check`; neither
target requires a GPU.

Build and stage the kernel:

```bash
make build-kernel
```

This builds `cuda/libfstatistic.so` and stages a copy to:

```text
~/.cache/pilot_proxy/libfstatistic.so
```

After building, load the library through Python and print its compile-time
contract:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python - <<'PY'
from pilot_proxy.kernel import FStatKernel
kernel = FStatKernel()
print(kernel.specs.as_descriptive_dict())
print(kernel.features.as_dict())
print(kernel.version.as_string())
PY
```

This output describes the CUDA kernel, not the complete receiver frame.
`detector_window_samples=128` is `K`. It is both the detector-row length and the
number of coefficients in each packed weight vector: target, lower reference,
and upper reference. It is **not** the receiver frame length.

The receiver profile supplies `frame_size_samples`. Both shipped profiles set
`frame_size_samples=16384`, so the tested configuration gives:

```text
windows_per_stream = frame_size_samples / detector_window_samples
                   = 16384 / 128
                   = 128

detector_rows_per_frame = num_input_streams * num_selected_channels * windows_per_stream
```

For the target CHIME profile and one selected coarse channel, the row count is:

```text
2048 feed-pol streams * 1 selected channel * 128 windows_per_stream = 262144 rows
```

Thus, one frame in this profile is packed as `(262144, 128)`, and a batch is
packed as `(frames_in_chunk, 262144, 128)`. The kernel sums the target and
reference powers over every detector row before it forms one F-statistic for the
frame or block. This geometry is conditional on the profile's 16384-sample
frame. Use `check-layout` to print and validate the geometry derived from the
profile:

```bash
pilot-proxy check-layout \
    --receiver-profile configs/receiver_profiles/chime_dtv_fengine.json \
    --stream-map configs/stream_maps/chime_feed_pol_example.json
```

This command checks the configuration, not a CHIME file. Because the CHIME
profile is marked as requiring data-product verification, compare its frame
size, stream count, and ordering with the operational data product separately.

The shared library is loaded by PilotProxy and is not executed directly.

Run the compiled CUDA/C++ regression tests with:

```bash
make test-kernel
```

## CHIME / datatrawl archive workflow

To retain datatrawl's staging bound during an archive-scale run, we use
`pilot-proxy chime-scan`. It runs the PilotProxy analyzer through datatrawl,
writes one product for each selected pilot with usable input, and attempts to
combine those products into the canonical CHIME outputs. If no `(event,
frame-in-file)` identity is common to every completed pilot, the scan preserves
the per-pilot products and defers stacking until a compatible channel subset is
chosen with `pilot-proxy chime-combine`. Two constraints determine how we run
it:

- **Selection uses the CHIME `freq_id` coarse-channel namespace**, not ATSC
  physical-channel numbers. For `--source cadc-datatrail`, omitting `--select`
  scans each `freq_id` present in the inventory. The command prints that set
  before staging begins. Pass `--select` to restrict it. The
  `--inventory` and `--inventory-name` flags also let `chime-scan` infer the
  archive source. The 23 `freq_id`s for the default ATSC 14-36 pilot range are
  listed in
  [docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md](docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md#selection-convention); `844` is
  the single-channel smoke-test value for the ATSC 14 pilot.
- **Use `chime-scan` for the supported path.** The analyzer appends frames in
  delivery order. `chime-scan` forces one download worker and one staged file so
  that file delivery follows source order. A raw `datatrawl scan` must reproduce
  this constraint and explicitly select `chime-baseband-packed`.

The following documents give the complete selection rules, local and
CADC/CANFAR sequences, order constraint, and post-processing commands:

- **[INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md)** --- datatrawl integration contract.
- **[docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md](docs/CANFAR_RUNBOOK.md)** --- step-by-step CANFAR
  operating procedure.

## Standalone synthetic/testbench workflow

When GNU Radio is installed only in the system Python, the standalone workflow
uses two interpreters:

- GNU Radio Python for ATSC generation and GNU Radio AWGN;
- CUDA Python for CuPy and the CUDA F-statistic library.

Generate an ATSC waveform without injected noise:

```bash
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH=src /usr/bin/python3   -m pilot_proxy.testbench.generate_atsc_signal   --output-iq generated/atsc/atsc_8vsb_complex64.cfile   --num-iq-samples 600000
```

Audit the generated waveform:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python   -m pilot_proxy.testbench.audit_atsc_signal   --input-iq generated/atsc/atsc_8vsb_complex64.cfile   --fail-on-quality
```

The audit writes `generated/atsc/atsc_waveform_audit.json` and reports five
measured properties: pilot frequency error, pilot level relative to the data
shelf, occupied bandwidth, shelf flatness, and channel-edge rolloff. A waveform
that meets all configured bounds prints `quality_passed=True (5/5)` and the
margin for each check. With `--fail-on-quality`, the command exits nonzero when
any bound is not met. This result validates the generated waveform against those
five checks; it does not validate a receiver implementation.

Pack detector input:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python   -m pilot_proxy.testbench.quantize   --input-iq generated/atsc/atsc_8vsb_complex64.cfile   --physical-channel 14   --frame-size-samples 16384   --num-input-streams 1
```

Run a small SNR evaluation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python   -m pilot_proxy.testbench.evaluate_snr   --input-iq generated/atsc/atsc_8vsb_complex64.cfile   --physical-channel 14   --frame-size-samples 16384   --num-input-streams 1   --requested-snr-shelf-db -26   --noise-trials 10
```

This command writes `generated/dtv_snr_eval/dtv_snr_summary.csv`. The
`snr_error_db_mean` and `snr_error_db_std` columns summarize estimated shelf SNR
minus the injected or measured reference. For the packed fixed-point path,
`cpu_gpu_abs_diff_max` measures agreement between the CUDA detector and the CPU
reference and is expected to be zero. Ten noise trials provide a smoke test,
not a final uncertainty estimate. Increase `--noise-trials` when the uncertainty
of the reported mean and standard deviation matters.

---

## Figures

We use LaTeX-style fonts for figures. By default, Matplotlib renders Computer
Modern with mathtext, which does not require a TeX installation. Set
`PILOT_PROXY_USE_TEX=1` to use external TeX when `latex`, `dvipng`, and the
`cm-super` fonts are installed. CI leaves this option disabled. Figure writers
emit 300 dpi PNG files by default. Set
`PILOT_PROXY_FIGURE_FORMATS=png,pdf` to write a vector PDF with the same stem.

## Build documentation

Generated PDFs are ignored by git. Build them locally with:

```bash
make docs        # latexmk; scratch in docs/auxil/, PDFs in docs/out/
```

The checked Debian/Ubuntu package set is:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
    texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra \
    texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-pictures lmodern latexmk
```

Figures rendered with `PILOT_PROXY_USE_TEX=1` also require
`dvipng cm-super ghostscript`. The tested CANFAR session images do not provide
TeX or root access, so build the documentation outside the session.

---

## Commit hygiene

Before committing, remove generated products and local build artifacts, then
check the remaining tree:

```bash
make release-clean
make commit-check
```

## Compatibility note: datatrawl inventory metadata

`pilot-proxy chime-scan` selects `chime-baseband-packed` for
`pilot-proxy-detector`, overriding the inventory's canonical-reader metadata on
the supported path. [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md#compatibility-note-datatrawl-inventory-metadata)
explains why this override is required and how to supply it when invoking raw
`datatrawl scan` directly.

## Release history and citation

We maintain release notes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and provide a
machine-readable software citation in [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).

Use `pilot-proxy --version` to report the installed package version.
