# PilotProxy Data Products

This document defines the canonical files produced by the CHIME real-data
workflows. `chime-run` writes the products directly from one staged directory.
`chime-scan` first writes one authoritative `<freq_id>.npz` product per coarse
channel and then combines those products on a shared event/frame identity. The
two paths use the same canonical detector, cache, reduction, table, and plotting
formats where those formats apply.

Unless stated otherwise, `mask = 1` means that the frame is rejected and
`valid = 1` means that the reference denominator is nonzero.

The current per-pilot schema and its explicit active/diagnostic/candidate
decision contract are defined in `PRODUCT_SCHEMA.md`. Its fine-reduction
products (`fine_power_u64`, the exact `uint64` target, lower, and upper
terms per fine bin from the frozen `fxfft256`, plus the fine scalars
`fine_status`, `fine_num_bins`, `fine_pad_factor`, `fine_guard_fine_bins`,
`fine_p_fa`, `fine_designated_bins`, and `fine_census_excluded_bins`) live
only in the authoritative per-pilot `<freq_id>.npz` files. The null-bulk
calibration and the detection list are not stored; they are recomputed
offline from `fine_power_u64`. The combined
outputs below carry no fine arrays; analyses of fine detections read the
per-pilot products directly.

## JSON Files

### `run_config.json`

This file records the run-level detector contract and provenance. Both workflows
use:

- `schema_version = pilotproxy_chime_run_config_v1`;
- `detector_contract`;
- `physical_channels`;
- `mask_policy`;
- `reference_placement_summary` when placement metadata are available.

The staged `chime-run` path also records fields such as `input_dir`,
`output_dir`, `weight_coordinate`, and file-level `provenance`. The combined
`chime-scan` path instead records `source = chime-scan`,
`freq_id_by_pilot`, and `detector_provenance_by_pilot`. Consumers should use
the schema and named fields rather than assume that the two producers have
byte-identical JSON.

### `stats.json`

This file records the detector geometry and run statistics. Shared fields
include:

- `schema_version = pilotproxy_chime_stats_v1`;
- `detector_contract`;
- `num_frames` and `num_pilots`;
- `num_input_streams`;
- `windows_per_stream`;
- `mask_policy`;
- `reference_placement_summary` when available.

`chime-run` also records `detector_rows_per_frame`, `kernel_specs`,
`weight_coordinate`, and `null_power_ratio_by_channel`. A `chime-scan` combine records
`combine_alignment`, `rational_overflow_count_by_pilot`, and any cross-build
provenance notes. The combined scan keeps `null_power_ratio` in
`chime_detector_outputs.npz` rather than copying it into `stats.json`.

The `detector_contract` states the coordinate convention through:

- `weight_coordinate_system`;
- `input_coordinate_system`;
- `input_preprocessing.time_reverse_detector_windows_before_kernel`.

### `input_manifest.json`

This file records the HDF5 inputs using one of two explicit document shapes:

- the staged runner writes `pilotproxy_chime_input_manifest_v1` with
  `input_dir`, `absolute_time_used`, and discovered `datasets` metadata;
- the archive combine writes receiver-neutral
  `pilotproxy_scan_input_manifest_v1` with `source`, `physical_channels`, and
  the `input_files` unit keys collected from the per-pilot products.

The distinct identities prevent consumers from interpreting one manifest shape
as the other.

### `product_validation.json`

`pilot-proxy validate-products --output-json ...` writes this report; it is not
created merely by running the detector. Its principal fields are:

- `valid`;
- `num_errors`;
- `errors`.

### `.pilotproxy-combine-generation.json`

`chime-scan`/`chime-combine` publishes this hidden generation manifest last.
It contains a unique generation ID and SHA-256 digest for every canonical file
in that combined output set. A failed publication that is rolled back also
advances the generation ID. `validate-products` reads the identity before and
after validation, checks the file digests, and refuses a run if publication
overlapped its reads. The hidden `.pilotproxy-combine-publish.json` journal is
present only while a transaction needs completion or recovery and also makes
validation fail closed. A kernel-backed exclusive publish lock serializes
writers across recovery, journal preparation, and canonical replacement; a
second writer cannot replace or remove the active writer's journal.

Direct `chime-run` outputs predate and do not require the combine-generation
manifest; in the absence of both combine metadata files they retain their
existing validation behavior.

## Detector NPZ

### `chime_detector_outputs.npz`

This is the canonical frame-by-pilot detector product.

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Units | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `physical_channel` | `(num_pilots,)` | `int32` | channel | ATSC physical channel |
| `pilot_frequency_hz` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | Hz | ATSC pilot RF frequency |
| `chime_frequency_hz` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | Hz | CHIME coarse-channel center |
| `frame_index` | `(num_frames,)` | `int64` | frame | Contiguous positional frame index |
| `p_target_u64` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `uint64` | power | Target-bin power |
| `p_ref_sum_u64` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `uint64` | power | Lower plus upper reference power |
| `coarse_power_ratio` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `float64` | unitless | `2*p_target/p_ref_sum` |
| `normalized_coarse_power_ratio_db` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `float64` | dB | `10*log10(F/null_power_ratio)` |
| `pilot_excess_db` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `float64` | dB | One-bin pilot-excess PNR |
| `estimated_data_shelf_snr_db` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `float64` | dB | Estimated ATSC data-shelf SNR; finite only where its transform is defined |
| `valid` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `uint8` | 0/1 | `p_ref_sum != 0` |
| `mask` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `uint8` | 0/1 | `1 = reject` under the recorded mask rule |
| `target_norm_sq` | `(num_pilots,)` | `int64` | unitless | Exact `||w_target||^2` of the int4 weights |
| `reference_norm_sum_sq` | `(num_pilots,)` | `int64` | unitless | Exact `||w_ref_lo||^2 + ||w_ref_up||^2` |
| `null_power_ratio` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | unitless | `2*target_norm_sq/reference_norm_sum_sq`, the weight-norm H0 reference |
| `normalized_pilot_excess` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `float64` | unitless | `F/null_power_ratio - 1`, or NaN for invalid frames |

The current mask is the norm-corrected positive-excess comparison:

```text
valid && (p_target * reference_norm_sum_sq > target_norm_sq * p_ref_sum)
```

This is the integer form of `F > null_power_ratio`. Because
`normalized_coarse_power_ratio_db` is referenced to `null_power_ratio`, the
null and the positive-excess boundary both sit at exactly 0 dB. The current
product contract requires the exact powers, all norm-related arrays, schema
identity, and decision contract. Development snapshots that predate this
contract are not accepted; regenerate them from authoritative inputs.

For `chime-scan`, `num_frames` is the event/frame intersection retained by the
combine. The source per-pilot products can contain additional frames that were
not common to every channel.

## Spectrogram Cache NPZ

### `chime_spectrogram_cache.npz`

This cache carries the frame-level baseband power and the matching detector
mask used by the plotting functions.

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Units | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `baseband_power_linear` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `float64` | power | Mean non-coherent baseband power for the frame |
| `baseband_power_db` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `float64` | dB | `10*log10(baseband_power_linear)` where power is positive |
| `mask` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `uint8` | 0/1 | Detector rejection mask copied from the detector product |
| `valid` | `(num_frames, num_pilots)` | `uint8` | 0/1 | Detector validity copied from the detector product |
| `physical_channel` | `(num_pilots,)` | `int32` | channel | ATSC physical channel |
| `pilot_frequency_hz` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | Hz | ATSC pilot RF frequency |
| `chime_frequency_hz` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | Hz | CHIME coarse-channel center |
| `frame_index` | `(num_frames,)` | `int64` | frame | Contiguous positional frame index |
| `relative_time_s` | `(num_frames,)` | `float64` | s | `frame_index*nfft/sample_rate_hz` |

`relative_time_s` is accumulated data time. It does not restore gaps between
separate archive events and should not be interpreted as wall-clock time.

## Integrated Spectra NPZ

### `chime_integrated_spectra.npz`

The `chime-scan` combine writes a reporting stack of the integrated spectra in
the per-pilot products. The analyzer uses a rectangular-window FFT, sums
`|FFT|^2` over input streams, and accumulates over frames. `before` includes
valid frames; `after` includes valid frames with `reject_mask = 0`. Therefore
`before - after` is the accumulated spectrum of the rejected frames.

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Units | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | scalar | `str` | — | `pilotproxy_chime_integrated_spectra_v1` |
| `physical_channel` | `(num_pilots,)` | `int32` | channel | ATSC physical channel |
| `pilot_frequency_hz` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | Hz | ATSC pilot RF frequency |
| `chime_frequency_hz` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | Hz | CHIME coarse-channel center |
| `freq_id` | `(num_pilots,)` | `int64` | id | CHIME coarse-channel identifier when recorded |
| `integrated_spectrum_before_mask` | `(num_pilots, nfft)` | `float64` | power | Sum over valid frames |
| `integrated_spectrum_after_mask` | `(num_pilots, nfft)` | `float64` | power | Sum over valid, kept frames |
| `masked_fraction_by_channel` | `(num_pilots,)` | `float64` | 0..1 | Rejected valid frames divided by valid frames; NaN when none are valid |
| `sample_rate_hz` | scalar | `float64` | Hz | Shared per-channel sample rate, or NaN when timing metadata are unavailable |
| `nfft` | scalar | `int64` | bins | FFT length recorded by the per-pilot products |

Bin `k` maps to baseband frequency as:

```text
((k + nfft//2) % nfft - nfft//2) * sample_rate_hz / nfft
```

The authoritative copy remains in each `_per_pilot/<freq_id>.npz`; see
`PER_PILOT_PRODUCT_FIELDS.md`. Integrated spectra are accumulated before terminal
event intersection, so they represent each pilot's full processed frame set.
The canonical frame arrays can represent a smaller all-channel intersection.
This distinction is recorded by the per-pilot products and
`stats.json.combine_alignment`.

## Reductions NPZ

### `chime_reductions_10s.npz`

This file groups the canonical frame arrays into approximately 10 s of
contiguous data time. The grouping uses `frame_index`, the analysis frame length,
and the sample rate recorded by the products; it does not use the per-file
absolute-time axis.

All arrays below have a leading dimension of `num_chunks`. Arrays that also
vary by pilot have shape `(num_chunks, num_pilots)`.

- `chunk_index`, `chunk_start_frame`, `chunk_stop_frame`;
- `input_power_mean`, `cleaned_power_mean`;
- `mask_fraction`, `mask_fraction_valid`, `mask_fraction_total`;
- `unmasked_count`, `total_count`, `valid_count`, `invalid_count`;
- `masked_count_valid`, `unmasked_count_valid`;
- `normalized_coarse_power_ratio_db_median`, `normalized_coarse_power_ratio_db_p95`, `normalized_coarse_power_ratio_db_max`;
- `estimated_data_shelf_snr_db_median`, `estimated_data_shelf_snr_db_p95`, `estimated_data_shelf_snr_db_max`.

`cleaned_power_mean` is the mean over valid frames with `mask = 0`; it is NaN
when a chunk contains no such frame. The term “cleaned” is a product-field name,
not a claim that all interference has been removed.

## Control-Band NPZ

### `<freq_id>.npz` (`pilotproxy_control_product_v1`, analyzer `pilot-proxy-control`)

One resumable product per selected non-pilot `freq_id` (null-control,
mid-allocation transfer, and canary bins). The detector is not defined on
these channels; this product records what the control science needs and
nothing that could be mistaken for a mask decision.

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `baseband_power_linear` | `(n_frames,)` | `float64` | Mean `abs(x)**2` per frame over samples and feeds, native offset-binary units (same convention as the detector product) |
| `coarse_marginal` | `(n_frames, 128)` | `float64` | Rectangular 128-point window power marginal, mean over windows and feeds, native (unshifted) bin order in the reader's baseband orientation |
| `frame_unit_index` | `(n_frames,)` | `int32` | Row into `unit_keys` / `files` |
| `frame_in_unit` | `(n_frames,)` | `int32` | Frame position within the source file |
| `integrated_spectrum_sum`, `integrated_spectrum_count` | `(nfft,)`, scalar | `float64`, int | Rectangular full-resolution `abs(FFT)**2`, feed-averaged, resumable sum/count |
| `source_event_keys` | `(n_units,)` | `str` | Event identity with this product's `freq_id` token removed — joins pilot products event-by-event |

Scalars: `freq_id`, `f_center_hz`, `fs_hz`, `nyquist_zone`, `nfft`,
`configured_nfft`, `detector_window_samples` (= 128), `reference_offset_bins`
(= 2), `n_feeds`, `n_frames`, `max_frames_per_file`, `analyzer_version`,
`schema_version`, `created`.

Two contracts worth stating:

- **Deployed-geometry F at any bin.** The 128-point rectangular DFT bin is the
  unit-modulus (float) analogue of the deployed detector's 128-sample weighted
  dot product, so `F(b) = 2*S[b] / (S[b-2] + S[b+2])` (indices mod 128)
  reproduces the coarse statistic's geometry at any target — including a
  virtual-pilot bin on a channel with no transmitter — with `mu0 = 1` exactly.
  The deployed weights are int-quantized; agreement with a detector product is
  a family statement, quantified by running this analyzer on a pilot `freq_id`
  and comparing, not assumed.
- **Parseval self-check.** Per frame,
  `coarse_marginal.sum() == 128**2 * baseband_power_linear` to float64
  roundoff. A product violating this is corrupt.

Absolute times are deliberately absent: epoch dating flows through
`source_event_keys` (inventory event dates, or a paired pilot product's time
axis).

"Native offset-binary units" describes the decoded integer coordinate, not a
raw byte value. In particular, a mean power of exactly 128 proves every decoded
sample is `(-8,-8)`: native raw byte `0x00`, or `0x88` only after the detector's
two's-complement repack. The completed-archive gate and the resulting exact
DC-only integrated-spectrum subtraction are specified in
[`ARCHIVE_HEALTH_REPAIR.md`](ARCHIVE_HEALTH_REPAIR.md).

## Frame Identity NPZ

### `chime_frame_identity.npz`

An event-keyed `chime-scan` combine writes the identities retained in the
canonical stack:

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `frame_event_key` | `(num_frames,)` | `str` | Source event identity with the per-channel `freq_id` token removed |
| `frame_in_unit` | `(num_frames,)` | `int64` | Frame position within the source file |

The event key, per-unit index, and frame-within-unit identity are mandatory.
Products without those tags are rejected rather than positionally aligned.

## Tables

Tables are written under `tables/`:

- `mask_summary_by_pilot.csv` is written by the detector/combine path;
- `spectrum_before_after.csv` is written by `chime-run` and regenerated by the
  baseband spectrum plot;
- `normalized_coarse_power_ratio_summary_by_channel.csv` and
  `data_shelf_snr_histogram_summary.csv` are written by `chime-plot` or
  `chime-run --plot`.

The data-shelf SNR summary is derived from the norm-corrected pilot excess and therefore uses the same null coordinate as `reject_mask`.

## Figures

`pilot-proxy chime-plot` or `chime-run --plot` writes these figures under
`figures/`:

- `data_shelf_snr_histogram_by_channel.png`;
- `coarse_power_ratio_survival_by_channel.png`;
- `normalized_coarse_power_ratio_db_spectrogram.png`;
- `baseband_spectrogram.png`;
- `baseband_spectrum_before_after_mask.png`;
- `mask_spectrogram.png`.

PNG is the default. Setting `PILOT_PROXY_FIGURE_FORMATS=png,pdf` adds PDF copies
without changing the numerical products.
