# Per-pilot product field reference

This document defines the fields in the only supported public per-pilot
product. The product identity and decision semantics are defined in
[`PRODUCT_SCHEMA.md`](PRODUCT_SCHEMA.md); fine-reduction-specific arrays are
listed in [`FINE_REDUCTION_PRODUCTS.md`](FINE_REDUCTION_PRODUCTS.md).

```text
schema_name = "pilotproxy_per_pilot_product"
schema_revision = 5
schema_version = "pilotproxy_per_pilot_product_v5"
source_event_key_schema_version = "pilotproxy_namespaced_source_event_key_v1"
```

The `pilot-proxy-detector` analyzer writes one product for one selected receiver
coarse channel. `reject_mask = 1` means reject. Event-keyed frame identity,
exact weight norms, detector provenance, and the decision contract are
mandatory. Products missing them are invalid and must be regenerated.

In the tables below, `N` is the number of detector frames and `U` is the number
of consumed input files.
## Identity and geometry

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `freq_id` | `(1,)` | `int64` | CHIME coarse-channel identifier |
| `physical_channel` | `(1,)` | `int32` | Nearest ATSC physical channel |
| `pilot_in_band` | `(1,)` | `uint8` | `1` when the selected coarse channel contains the nominal ATSC pilot |
| `pilot_frequency_hz` | `(1,)` | `float64` | ATSC pilot RF frequency |
| `chime_frequency_hz` | `(1,)` | `float64` | CHIME coarse-channel center |
| `nfft` | scalar | `int64` | Analysis frame and FFT length used for this product |
| `sample_rate_hz` | scalar | `float64` | Positive acquisition sample rate; finite `unit_delta_time` values must equal its reciprocal |
| `detector_window_samples` | scalar | `int64` | Receiver-selected CUDA detector window `K` (128 for CHIME; 64 for the current CHORD profiles) |
| `num_input_streams` | scalar | `int64` | Input feed/polarization streams summed |
| `sense` | scalar | `int64` | Spectral sense, `+1` or `-1` |
| `source_event_key_schema_version` | scalar | `str` | Required namespaced event-identity contract; legacy basename-only products are rejected |

The schema does not fix `nfft` to one value. The current software profile and
tests use 16,384 samples, which is associated with the planned CHIME engine
upgrade. The active acquisition value must be recorded from the run; a
12,288-sample current-frame value remains provisional until independently
verified. Any accepted value must be divisible by `K`.

If the nominal ATSC pilot does not fall within half a coarse-channel bandwidth,
the analyzer sets `pilot_in_band = 0`. It still emits one row per input frame,
but sets `valid = 0`, `reject_mask = 0`, and the integer detector powers to
zero. Derived detector values and `baseband_power_linear` are NaN, and neither
integrated spectrum receives the frame.

## Per-frame detector output (length `N`)

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `frame_index` | `(N,)` | `int64` | Zero-based positional frame counter |
| `p_target_u64` | `(N, 1)` | `uint64` | Target-bin power from the fixed-point detector |
| `p_ref_sum_u64` | `(N, 1)` | `uint64` | Lower plus upper reference power |
| `p_ref_lower_u64` | `(N, 1)` | `uint64` | Lower reference power, kept unsummed |
| `p_ref_upper_u64` | `(N, 1)` | `uint64` | Upper reference power, kept unsummed |
| `fine_power_u64` | `(N, 3, 256)` when enabled; `(N, 0, 0)` otherwise | `uint64` | **Exact** fine-power terms from the frozen `fxfft256`; never a zero placeholder |
| `psd_frame_db_i16` | `(N, 16384)` | `int16` | Per-frame PSD, feeds summed, in dB about `psd_db_reference` |
| `coarse_power_ratio` | `(N, 1)` | `float64` | `2*p_target/p_ref_sum` |
| `normalized_coarse_power_ratio_db` | `(N, 1)` | `float64` | `10*log10(F)` |
| `pilot_excess_db` | `(N, 1)` | `float64` | One-bin pilot-excess PNR |
| `estimated_data_shelf_snr_db` | `(N, 1)` | `float64` | Estimated ATSC data-shelf SNR |
| `valid` | `(N, 1)` | `uint8` | `p_ref_sum != 0` |
| `reject_mask` | `(N, 1)` | `uint8` | `1 = discard` under the recorded positive-excess rule |
| `normalized_pilot_excess` | `(N, 1)` | `float64` | `F/null_power_ratio - 1`, or NaN when invalid |
| `target_norm_sq` | `(1,)` | `int64` | Exact `||w_target||^2` of the int4 weights |
| `reference_norm_sum_sq` | `(1,)` | `int64` | Exact `||w_ref_lo||^2 + ||w_ref_up||^2` |
| `baseband_power_linear` | `(N, 1)` | `float64` | Mean non-coherent baseband power for the frame |
| `railed_sample_count` | `(N, 1)` | `uint64` | 4-bit components on either rail (nibble 0 or 15), counted from the raw frame; components of `0x00` fill bytes are excluded and counted below |
| `fill_sample_count` | `(N, 1)` | `uint64` | Components in `0x00` bytes, the archive's missing-data fill signature (a genuinely doubly-negative-railed sample is indistinguishable and lands here) |
| `railed_sample_total` | `(N, 1)` | `uint64` | Shared denominator for both counts: `2 * nfft * streams` |
| `psd_db_step_per_code` | `()` | `float64` | dB per `psd_frame_db_i16` code; `0.01` |

ADC/F-engine saturation is recorded per frame because it **cannot be recovered
afterwards**: the product stores no raw samples (5.8 MB against 8.0 GB for one
pre-flight channel). `baseband_power_linear == 128` only catches a frame that is
railed everywhere, so partial saturation was previously invisible. The counts
cover real and imaginary parts separately and are written for invalid frames too,
since clipping is a property of the samples rather than of the detection. The
`0x00` byte is the archive's documented missing-data fill signature (the same
one `archive_health` excludes whole frames for), so its components are split
into `fill_sample_count` rather than recorded as clipping; without the split, a
frame partially overlapping absent baseband would be permanently misrecorded as
saturated. Measured
on real CHIME baseband (freq_id 506): median 795 of 67,108,864 components
(0.0012%), with the worst frame at 18,948 (0.028%) -- a 24x frame-to-frame spread
that nothing in the product previously exposed.

`null_power_ratio` was stored through schema v2 and is **no longer written**: it
is exactly `2*target_norm_sq/reference_norm_sum_sq` from two fields above, so
storing it added a value that could disagree with its own inputs. The formulas
below that name it are still correct; compute it rather than reading it.

### Fine-decision contract (scalars, one per product)

Written whenever the fine terms are computed. The scan applies no fine decision
itself --- these record the contract the terms were produced under, so
post-processing can decide and replay exactly.

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `fine_status` | `()` | `str` | `enabled` when terms exist; `pending` only for an empty checkpoint; otherwise an explicit no-measurement reason |
| `fine_num_bins` | `()` | `int64` | Fine transform length actually used (`256` when enabled, otherwise `0`) |
| `fine_pad_factor` | `()` | `int64` | Zero-padding factor of the fine transform (`2`) |
| `fine_guard_fine_bins` | `()` | `int64` | Guard bins excluded either side of the designated window (`1`) |
| `fine_p_fa` | `()` | `float64` | Declared per-bin false-alarm rate (`0.001`) |
| `fine_designated_bins` | `(D,)` | `int64` | Designated-window bin indices |
| `fine_census_excluded_bins` | `(E,)` | `int64` | Bins excluded from the census; empty when none |
| `decision_contract_json` | `()` | `str` | The whole contract as JSON, for exact replay |

An older v5 no-measurement checkpoint can contain an all-zero
`(N, 3, B)` placeholder. Resume accepts that one form and rewrites it as the
canonical `(N, 0, 0)` array with zero bins. Current products never create the
placeholder, and any nonzero value is invalid.

### Per-unit fields (length equal to `unit_order`)

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `unit_scope` | `(U,)` | `str` | Source archive disposition of each unit, aligned 1:1 with `unit_order` |

`unit_scope` is **per unit, not per frame** --- do not index it with a frame
number. It is populated from the source's inventory row, so a `--source local`
run leaves it empty; only an archive source supplies a meaningful value.

`weight_coefficients_sha256` `()` `str` is listed under Provenance below.

The product stores `p_target_u64` and `p_ref_sum_u64` without converting them to
a thresholded statistic. We can therefore recompute an alternative F threshold
or dB calibration from the same detector pass, provided the required calibration
constants are also used. This does not require rerunning the CUDA detector.

### Why the per-frame PSD is retained (schema v3)

The analyzer already ran one 16384-point FFT over all 2048 feeds every frame and
power-summed it; v1 and v2 folded that array into `integrated_spectrum_*` and
discarded the per-frame result. `archive_health.SPECTRAL_LIMITATION` states the
consequence directly: the gate "cannot apply an arbitrary new frame mask, FFT
window, or threshold to the archived spectra."

Retaining it therefore costs **no compute** --- only bytes. Decode with:

```python
psd = psd_db_reference * 10.0 ** (psd_frame_db_i16 / 1000.0)
psd[psd_frame_db_i16 == psd_db_invalid_code] = numpy.nan
```

Frames that never reached the transform carry `psd_db_invalid_code`
(`-32768`), which is deliberately outside the clipped code range so it cannot
be confused with a measured level.

The int16-in-dB encoding is chosen from measurement, not preference. On a real
Channel 36 capture the PSD spans only 18.3 dB, so 0.01 dB steps give a
round-trip error of 0.005 dB maximum and 0.0025 dB median --- far below
anything that matters for locating peaks or placing detector cell boundaries
--- at half the size of `float32` and a third of its deflated size. `float16`
is unusable: the values sit at 10^8--10^9 and every bin overflows.

Summing the retained frames reproduces `integrated_spectrum_before_mask` to
7.7e-4 relative, the quantisation limit, so the accumulators the product still
carries are derivable rather than independent.

### Why the exact fine terms are retained (schema v2)

`fine_power_u64` is the sufficient statistic for every fine decision. It holds
the three exact `uint64` power terms per fine bin --- target, lower reference,
upper reference --- produced by the frozen fixed-point `fxfft256`, which is the
transform the deployed kernel uses.

Schema v1 kept only `fine_power_ratio`: one `float32` per bin, formed with a
*floating* numpy FFT. That lost two independent things, neither recoverable
without reprocessing the raw archive:

1. **The split.** Three `uint64` values were collapsed into their ratio. The
   frozen decision `fine_mask_decision` requires `uint64 [3, 256]` and rejects
   any other dtype, so a v1 product cannot replay the deployed decision at all,
   at any threshold.
2. **The transform.** The float FFT and `fxfft256` disagree by up to ~5e-5
   relative, so the stored ratio is not the deployed quantity even in
   principle.

With `fine_power_u64` retained, everything downstream of the transform ---
the ratio, the CFAR location/scale/threshold, the null bulk, the designated-set
decision, and any future `eta` or Q16 multiplier --- is exactly recomputable
offline. Nothing recovers it afterwards, and a rescan costs weeks.

Cost is about 4.4 kB per frame after npz deflate (6,144 B raw), roughly 3.3 GB
across a 750k-frame archive. Observed values need 46 bits at the 2048-stream
geometry, so `uint64` is both necessary and sufficient.

`p_ref_lower_u64` and `p_ref_upper_u64` are kept for the same reason at the
coarse level: the sum alone cannot show that only one reference window was
contaminated.

All four coarse power fields are exact `uint64 (N, 1)` arrays. The product
contract checks each split in Python integer arithmetic and rejects overflow or
any row where lower plus upper does not equal `p_ref_sum_u64`. A backend that
omits one of these terms fails instead of writing a placeholder.

### Mask convention

The current `reject_mask` compares the target and reference powers after
correcting for unequal quantized weight norms. A valid frame is rejected when:

```text
reject_mask = valid && (p_target_u64 * reference_norm_sum_sq
                        > target_norm_sq * p_ref_sum_u64)
            = valid && (F > null_power_ratio)
```

The integer cross multiplication is the recorded `mask_rule`. It avoids a
floating-point threshold decision and uses the weight-norm flat-floor reference
`null_power_ratio = 2*target_norm_sq/reference_norm_sum_sq` rather than assuming `null_power_ratio = 1`.
The analyzer recomputes this bit from the exact stored powers and norms; a
backend-provided mask bit is not accepted as authoritative.

Reporting can derive `keep_mask = 1 - reject_mask`; the per-pilot product does
not store a second copy.

## Integrated power spectra

For each full analysis frame, the analyzer computes a rectangular-window FFT of
the raw samples, sums `|FFT|^2` over input streams, and accumulates the result.

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `integrated_spectrum_before_mask` | `(nfft,)` | `float64` | Sum over valid frames |
| `integrated_spectrum_after_mask` | `(nfft,)` | `float64` | Sum over valid frames with `reject_mask = 0` |

Therefore `before - after` is the accumulated spectrum of frames rejected by
the stored mask. The arrays are raw accumulated power; normalization by frame
count or input-stream count is a reporting choice.

Bin `k` maps to baseband frequency by:

```text
((k + nfft//2) % nfft - nfft//2) * fs / nfft
```

where `fs = 1 / unit_delta_time` when every contributing unit has the same
finite sample period. If the periods differ, one shared frequency axis is not
defined; the canonical combine rejects that mixture.

The production path uses CuPy when a GPU runtime is available, while tests can
use NumPy. Both implement the same FFT and float64 feed-sum accumulation, but
their results can differ by normal floating-point roundoff. The stored spectra
contain accumulated power rather than per-frame complex FFT values. As a
result, a different window or a different mask threshold requires a new spectral
pass; those choices cannot be reconstructed from these two accumulated arrays.

## Absolute-time axis

The packed HDF5 reader copies timing and event attributes from each file into a
per-unit table aligned with `unit_order`. Two per-frame arrays identify the
corresponding unit and the frame position within that unit. This avoids storing
one absolute timestamp per frame.

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `unit_time0_ctime` | `(U,)` | `float64` | File start UNIX time, or NaN when absent |
| `unit_time0_fpga` | `(U,)` | `uint64` | FPGA count at file start, or 0 when absent |
| `unit_event_id` | `(U,)` | `int64` | CHIME event identifier, or `-1` when absent |
| `unit_delta_time` | `(U,)` | `float64` | Sample period in seconds, or NaN when absent |
| `archive_version` | `(U,)` | `str` | CHIME archive version, or an empty string when absent |
| `frame_unit_index` | `(N,)` | `int32` | Unit index `u` for each frame |
| `frame_in_unit` | `(N,)` | `int32` | Zero-based frame position within unit `u` |

For frame `f`, compute wall time with:

```python
u = frame_unit_index[f]
t = unit_time0_ctime[u] + frame_in_unit[f] * nfft * unit_delta_time[u]
```

If a synthetic or incomplete file lacks the root attributes, the analyzer stores
`NaN / 0 / -1 / ""` and continues. Any LST or wall-time analysis must first
exclude those missing values.

## Provenance and calibration

| Array | Shape | Dtype | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `weights_hash` | scalar | `str` | SHA-256 of the selected packed weight profile |
| `weight_bank_sha256` | scalar | `str` | SHA-256 of the complete weight bank, or empty for injected weights |
| `weight_manifest_sha256` | scalar | `str` | SHA-256 of the adjacent manifest, or empty when unavailable |
| `weight_coefficients_sha256` | scalar | `str` | SHA-256 of the weight **coefficients alone**, excluding header fields, so a header-only change does not read as a different bank |
| `detector_version` | scalar | `str` | Package, source-tree, kernel, schema, and `K` identity string |
| `mask_rule` | scalar | `str` | Integer rejection rule used for this product |
| `reference_placement_json` | scalar | `str` | Selected reference-placement metadata encoded as JSON |
| `rational_overflow_count` | scalar | `uint64` | Accumulated fixed-point overflow telemetry |
| `max_chunks_per_file` | scalar | `int64` | Per-file cap, or `-1` when uncapped |
| `detector_contract_json` | scalar | `str` | Full detector contract encoded as JSON |
| `pilot_below_data_db` | scalar | `float64` | Pilot-to-data-shelf calibration constant |
| `bin_enbw_hz` | scalar | `float64` | Detector-bin equivalent noise bandwidth |
| `dtv_bandwidth_hz` | scalar | `float64` | Assumed DTV bandwidth |
| `pilot_capture_efficiency` | scalar | `float64` | Pilot capture-efficiency factor |

The file also stores keys needed for resume and channel alignment:

| Array | Shape | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `unit_keys` | `(U,)` | Sorted set of committed archive unit keys |
| `unit_order` | `(U,)` | Unit keys in analyzer consumption order |
| `source_event_keys` | `(U,)` | Namespaced event identity derived from the aligned `unit_order` entry and `freq_id`; combine recomputes and verifies every value |

`unit_keys` and `unit_order` must each be unique and contain the same exact set.
Every nonempty unit must own at least one frame through `frame_unit_index`; the
only allowed zero-frame resume checkpoint also has zero units. These rules stop
an unused unit from poisoning resume's completed-unit set.

Resume checks the schema, `freq_id`, frame cap, detector geometry, calibration,
weights, mask rule, detector contract, and reference placement. A source-tree
hash or package-version change makes the full `detector_version` differ and
stops the resume, even when the remaining geometry tokens match. This prevents
one checkpoint from appending frames produced by a second implementation and
then relabeling the earlier frames. Start a clean output directory for the new
build.

## Derived in reporting (not stored)

The frame-level fields support these downstream products without another CUDA
detector pass:

- `keep_mask = 1 - reject_mask`;
- local-reference power ratio histograms and survival curves from the raw integer powers;
- alternative frame-level thresholds from the raw powers and norms;
- masked fraction from `reject_mask` and `valid`;
- baseband before/after summaries from `baseband_power_linear` and a selected
  frame mask;
- per-frame wall time, and then LMST where the timing attributes and telescope
  longitude are available. The completed-archive v1 audit uses DRAO longitude
  -119.6175 degrees east-positive, publishes its UTC-as-UT1 GMST polynomial,
  and records frames whose sample period prevents time/exposure recovery.

The fine array supports two distinct retrospective roles. Geometry predicts a
broad +/-30-bin acquisition neighborhood. Within that neighborhood, the v1
archive audit may accept a narrow +/-2-bin line anchor independently in each
provisional UTC quarter when its health-filtered persistence and uniqueness
tests pass. It records refusals and external-line sentinels. Neither derived
object changes the stored coarse `reject_mask`, and the broad acquisition
window must not be called a final calibrated designation.

The stored integrated spectra support the spectrum before/after comparison for
the mask used during the run. They do not preserve enough information to apply a
new frame threshold or FFT window after the fact.

The completed-survey health repair is one narrow, proven exception rather than
a general remasking capability. A frame with `baseband_power_linear == 128`
must consist entirely of decoded `(-8,-8)` samples: native CHIME offset-binary
raw byte `0x00`, equivalently detector-input/post-repack two's-complement byte
`0x88`. Its rectangular-FFT contribution is therefore reconstructible and can
be subtracted from the accumulated spectra. Detector-invalid rows were never
accumulated. See [`ARCHIVE_HEALTH_REPAIR.md`](ARCHIVE_HEALTH_REPAIR.md). Any
other new frame exclusion still requires the original HDF5 data for a spectral
correction.

Full 6 MHz DTV-channel mask expansion is not part of this product. It requires a
larger pass over the neighboring coarse channels after the pilot detector has
been validated.
