# Test coverage

Run the CPU release checks and the required GPU checks before a release:

```sh
make release-check PYTHON=python3
make test-gpu PYTHON=python3 NVCC=/path/to/nvcc DETECTOR_WINDOW_SAMPLES=128
```

The GPU gate fails if a GPU test skips a missing device, library, dependency,
or compiler. The default library is built for K=128; the matrix also builds
K=64 in temporary directories. These builds do not replace a separately pinned
campaign library or install a library into the user cache.

GNU Radio uses its own Python environment on some hosts:

```sh
PILOT_PROXY_GNURADIO_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 \
  python3 -m pytest tests/testbench/test_add_awgn.py \
  tests/testbench/test_generate_atsc_signal.py -q
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 PYTHONPATH=src /usr/bin/python3 -m pytest \
  tests/testbench/test_evaluate_dtv_snr.py::test_gnuradio_awgn_helper_hits_requested_band_snr -q
```

The noise tests check sample counts on both sides of the vector-alignment
boundary, seed reproducibility, complex noise power, and bandwidth scaling.
The transmitter test checks the emitted pilot frequency against the requested
RF offset independently of the generated metadata.
An explicitly configured GNU Radio interpreter must work; import or execution
errors fail the tests.

The kernel matrix includes 128 padded stream slots with 16 or 32 active inputs
and zero-filled remaining slots. These correspond to the padded 64-dish,
two-polarization Pathfinder buffer. They do not assert which inputs are active
on the instrument.

## Limits and remaining work

Passing these tests establishes the tested contracts, not complete correctness.
Line coverage alone cannot establish physical sensitivity, calibration quality,
or concurrency safety. The hardware gate must also run on the deployment GPU.
Compute Sanitizer and a sustained full-pipeline shadow run remain separate
hardware checks.

The archive survey suite has 11 existing expected failures. They track legacy
inventory readability, missing survey provenance, collection-restoration
ambiguity and path validation, distinctions among empty/sub-floor/restored
objects, interruption reporting, and stale exported views after a crash.
Some are unconditional expected failures or design placeholders, so they need
real acceptance assertions before they can serve as regression gates. Do not
count them as passing validation. See `archive/test_publication_trust.py` and
the survey stress/durability suites.

Large-product tests require `PILOT_PROXY_ATTACHED_PRODUCTS` or `PP_PER_PILOT`.
The frozen-bundle rederivation additionally accepts
`PILOT_PROXY_DEEP_BUNDLE_CHECK=1`; it reads the preserved source product archive.
These checks validate existing artifacts and do not start a new campaign.

The pre-PR testbench changes reject invalid packing/noise requests and nonfinite
N2 timestamps, and make local header caches honor SHA-256 content identity.
They do not change CUDA arithmetic, FFT tables, shipped weights, or valid-input
quantization. The CHIME packed archive path preserves its native integer grid
and does not use the synthetic floating-point quantizer or GNU Radio noise
generator.
