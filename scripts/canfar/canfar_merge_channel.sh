# Copy-ahead merge: hand a channel finished by shard 3 to the shard that owns
# it in its --select list, so the owner skips the channel when it arrives.
#
#   bash /arc/home/dgormley/pp_switch/canfar_merge_channel.sh <channel>
#   (run on any session -- it works on /arc, and takes the same lock the scans do)
#
# Why this is sound: the per-channel product carries the full detector
# provenance (source hash, kernel hash, weights, contract), and the owner's
# resume() refuses anything that does not match its own. All three shards run
# the same frozen source and the same qualified kernel, so a product built by
# shard 3 is indistinguishable from one the owner would have built. Once the
# product AND that channel's quarantine rows are in the owner's directory, the
# owner finds every unit already disposed and prints
# "nothing to do -- selection already complete in this product".
#
# Refuses unless: shard 3 has fully disposed the channel (no failed, no
# unprocessed), the owner has no product for it yet, the owner is not
# currently working it, and the provenance matches an existing owner product.
