#
# Why: a download worker that dies takes the whole scan with it, and not
# every transient is retried inside fetch() -- a raw urllib3 ProtocolError
# ("Connection broken: IncompleteRead") escapes expected_errors(). The archive
# also has outages measured in hours (twice in the 24 h before this was
# written). Rather than change the frozen source mid-run, which would orphan
# every product built so far, this supervises from outside: the scan is
# resumable by design, so a restart costs only the units in flight.
#
# Two distinct situations, handled differently:
#   * gate REFUSED (archive down, cert, colocation): no scan ran. Wait with a
#     growing backoff and try again. This is how an outage is ridden out; it
#     is never counted as a failed run.
#   * scan RAN and exited: resume the moment it is gone. If it made no
#     progress, back off before the next attempt so a flapping archive is not
#     hammered; progress resets the backoff.
# It exits 0 only on the run's predeclared terminal state ("incomplete
# requested scope" -- only quarantined rows left). Kill with:
#   pkill -f canfar_supervise
