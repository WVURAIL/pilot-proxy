"""Boundary to the CHIME/FRB Datatrail CLI.

datatrail is a SURVEY-ONLY dependency. survey() uses it to discover the archive
landscape -- which scopes, datasets, and events exist -- and to resolve each
event's CADC common path. The bulk data path (cadcget / cadcinfo) goes straight
to CADC and never touches datatrail, so nothing here runs on the scan/fetch
path.

We talk to datatrail through the CLI's machine-readable mode -- `datatrail ls
--json` and `datatrail ps --json` -- the stable, public contract added upstream
in datatrail-cli 0.11.0 (CHIMEFRB/datatrail-cli#160). This avoids the two
fragile couplings a datatrail integration could otherwise take on: scraping the
CLI's Rich tables (terminal-width-dependent text) or importing
`dtcli.src.functions` (internal, unversioned). The payloads are plain dicts --
`ls` prints the `scopes` / `larger_datasets` / `datasets` / `error` dict
verbatim (exit 1 when `error` is present), and `ps` wraps the files+policies
pair as `{"dataset", "scope", "files", "policies"}` or an `{"error": ...}`
envelope with exit 1 -- and every adapter method maps them onto its
outage-vs-empty contract.

Invocation notes, guarding the failure classes that would otherwise bite:
  * The child is `sys.executable -m dtcli.cli`, never a `datatrail` looked up
    on PATH, so it uses the active environment.
  * dtcli's group callback prints an update-available banner to STDOUT before
    any command when PyPI shows a newer release; _extract_json() parses past
    any such preamble.
  * The child inherits the environment plus NO_COLOR=1 / TERM=dumb / PAGER=cat,
    so captured output is plain text and can never block on a pager.
  * Every call carries a hard timeout, so a wedged child cannot stall a survey
    worker forever.

One subtlety worth naming: a partial server degradation can surface as an odd
payload shape (a files or policies half decoded to a bare string). The CLI
reports those as an error envelope with exit 1, and this adapter maps that to
ok=False -- an outage, retried, never mistaken for emptiness -- which is the
contract every caller is written against.
