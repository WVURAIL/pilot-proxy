"""Key names inside the archived per-pilot survey products.

The 2020--2026 survey archive was written under the detector's original
measurement vocabulary; those npz keys are immutable historical data. The
current vocabulary renamed the measurements everywhere else, and
``scripts/check_current_measurement_vocabulary.py`` keeps the retired
spellings off every current surface -- except this module, its single
designated home. Read archived products through these constants; current
products use the current vocabulary directly and never need this module.
