"""CHIME coarse-channel (``freq_id``) helpers shared by the datatrawl analyzers.

A CHIME baseband file is one *coarse* channel of the F-engine: the 400 MHz band
(0..800 MHz top) split into 1024 channels of ``fs = 400e6 / 1024 = 390625`` Hz.
A file's ``freq_id`` (0..1023) is therefore recoverable from its centre
frequency -- the one quantity every reader's ``probe`` already exposes::

    f_center = f0 - freq_id * coarse_width        (f0 = 800 MHz, top of band)
    freq_id  = round((f0 - f_center) / coarse_width)

The analyzers *select* on ``freq_id`` (it is what the CADC file inventory and the
on-disk filenames key on) but *label* each product with the ATSC physical
channel the pilot falls in. Recording ``freq_id`` alongside the product lets the
(deferred) 6 MHz mask-expansion step find the sibling coarse channels of a
detected pilot without re-opening the raw files.
