"""Durability, resume and concurrency stress tests for the cadc-datatrail survey.

Every test here drives the REAL survey() loop -- the real SurveyStore
transaction, the real SurveyOutputLock, the real view renderer -- with only the
three live seams faked: event enumeration, `datatrail ps`, and cadcinfo. No
network, no Datatrail CLI, no CADC certificate.

The claims under test are the ones a third party must be able to trust:

  * a committed event is durable and is never committed partially;
  * an interrupted run resumes with zero duplicate rows and zero re-probes of
    already-committed events;
  * inventory.jsonl and the text ledgers are pure views of SQLite and are
    regenerated after any stop between commit and render;
  * the worker count is a performance knob only -- it cannot change one byte of
    the inventory; and
  * two surveys can never interleave in one directory, and an incompatible
    configuration can never append to an existing one.
