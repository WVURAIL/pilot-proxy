"""
The CADC probe boundary -- the code that decides whether a file EXISTS.

Every other survey test replaces `_cadc_size` wholesale, so the three lines
that turn a CADC answer into an archive verdict have never run under test.
That matters more than it looks: `_cadc_size` returning `(None, None)` is the
single decision that marks a file definitively ABSENT, which the survey then
turns into an `empty` event and, once aged, a permanent `aged-out` write-off.
Anything else must land in `errored`, which is retried and can never silently
delete a file from the inventory.

The classification is a substring match on the exception CLASS NAME
(`cadc.py:473`), so it is only as good as the names CADC raises. An expired or
missing certificate must NOT be mistaken for "file absent" -- that is the
failure mode that would silently shrink a published inventory.

Offline: no CADC, no network, no cert.
