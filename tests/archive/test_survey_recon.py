Offline tests for recon() -- the `--scopes-only` discovery walk, which
otherwise only exercises on CANFAR against the live Datatrail service.

No datatrail access. The CLI is faked at the same boundary
tests/archive/test_datatrail_adapter.py fakes it -- subprocess.run, BELOW the
adapter -- so every test here drives the real `datatrail ls --json` parsing and
therefore the real outage-vs-empty contract that recon is written against. A
fake stubbed in above the adapter (patching list_datasets_checked) would have
to re-state that contract itself, and could not tell a scope that did not
answer from a scope that answered "nothing".
