"""
Failure-injection stress tests for survey resume and durable state -- the
paths that only exercise when a real run is interrupted, resumed, or handed a
damaged output directory, which on CANFAR means "after the fact, in
production".

Measured with a stdlib line tracer over a full clean survey run (2026-08-28):
one uninterrupted survey executes 197 of survey_state.py's 292 executable
lines. Every integrity guard in SurveyStore.__init__ (a junk database, table
column drift, an unparseable or unsupported schema row), every branch of
load_attempts(), the manifest corruption/legacy refusals, the Windows lock
branch, and the periodic view flush at VIEW_FLUSH_INTERVAL were all cold.

Offline. The seams faked are exactly the two boundaries a survey has --
`datatrail_client.subprocess.run` (the CLI child) and
`CadcDatatrailSource._cadc_size` (the CADC probe) -- plus
`cadc._enumerate_events` where the test is not about enumeration. Everything
else (SurveyStore's transaction, SurveyOutputLock, render_views,
_commit_decision, the real reader) runs for real.

Interruption is injected on the MAIN thread from inside the fake CLI handler,
which survey() calls at cadc.py:616 before it touches the probe pool. A real
signal is delivered with signal.raise_signal(), so the default SIGINT handler
raises KeyboardInterrupt exactly where a Ctrl-C would -- deterministically,
with no sleeps and no subprocesses.
