"""Equality-boundary regression for the norm-corrected mask (strict `>`).

Random vectors essentially never hit exact rational equality, so `>` and
`>=` implementations pass identical parity tests; this pins the one input
class where they differ. Signature-adaptive on purpose: it asserts the
POLICY (equality is NOT excess) against whatever the reference exposes.
